# CS464-Fitts's Law in Osu README

## Maxwell Nieberger

### About
This is my term project for CS464: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction, Spring 2021 at CSU.
It is a study using publicly available osu replay files and a python parsing library to investigate the effect that difficulty according to Fitts's law has on a player's ability to correctly time inputs.
